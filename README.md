### Color Selection
I want my site to be colorful but also reable and not too much bright and hurt user eye and from that I decide to  made it look pastel, giving a user a soft, neutral, soothing feeling.

my site consist of 4 main color which is

### Planning Process
Project plan & timeline

- design : figma
    - the design process is what I found most difficult. it sometime hard to come up with good and creative idea especially the project is to be submit in just over a week.

- coding : vscode
    - once the design is done the process I start code my site start by doing it lay out and style each section one by one then putting it together, adding animation and testing it.

### Trello

I use trello to note what I need to do orderly and what aspect is require by educator and also trello help me a lot to remember when I come up with an idea that I want it to be on my site.

<strong>Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)</strong>
back in late

In 1994, the Internet went public.the early website is just a plain and static site and then it process it evolve from static to be animate, to be dynamic and when mobile device is more popular to use to access internet than desktop reponsive design come in to popular and up until now the internet for still evove a lot has change. the thing that was hard or couldnt do in the past become more efficient and easier for developper.

The main purpose of the Internet is offering effective information sharing and communication globally using computers. but the most aspect I think is change a lot in today world is how people advertising their product. In 2019 world we will see an ad all around website from the serch engine to video. it not just on the tv as it used to be and people start to watch every thing online over paper or tv now. I still remember when I was young as always see that every house must have a television but that doesnt seem to be the case in the present.
